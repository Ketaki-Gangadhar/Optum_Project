# UnCage
### It's time to heal Yourself!

In  this racing  life  our stress  meter is increasing  really  fast. Everyone<br>
do care for physical fitness but our  motive is to  aware people about  mental <br>
fitness also. Hence we created an app which will help people to cope  up  with<br>
stress , depression or mental illness. Our app is made in Android Studio using<br>
Native Android Development (JAVA + XML). It  is  provided by the login facility. <br>
Then there is a set of questions to analysis the current mental state of users.<br>
Above activities employ the use of scroll view, linear layout, buttons, text views, etc.<br>
Then there is a main activity which shows four different sections build using table layout.<br><br>
These sections are <b> Counselling, Healthcare, Openup</b> and <b> Suggestions.</b><br>
