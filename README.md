### It's time to heal Yourself!

In  this racing  life  our stress  meter is increasing  really  fast. Everyone<br>
do care for physical fitness but our  motive is to  aware people about  mental <br>
fitness also. Hence we created an app which will help people to cope  up  with<br>
stress , depression or mental illness. Our app is made in Android Studio using<br>
Native Android Development (JAVA + XML). It  is  provided by the login facility. <br>
Then there is a set of questions to analysis the current mental state of users.<br>
Above activities employ the use of scroll view, linear layout, buttons, text views, etc.<br>
Then there is a main activity which shows four different sections build using table layout.<br><br>
 These are: <br><br>
<b> 1.Counselling<br></b>
 This section have site links which recommend doctors in case user need it . User will  <br>
 be able to get information about counselllor or psychiatrist.<br>

<b> 2.Suggestions<br></b>
 This  section suggests  few  positive activities and  gives  good vibes and calmness. This <br>
 contains  few  motivating books recommendation  or  link  of meditation activities , etc. This <br>
 will help our user in healing and relaxing and divert mind from the cause of depression or mental illness.<br>

 <b>3.Open up <br></b>
