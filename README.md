# UnCage
### It's time to heal Yourself!

In  this racing  life  our stress  meter is increasing  really  fast. Everyone
do care for physical fitness but our  motive is to  aware people about  mental 
fitness also. Hence we created an app which will help people to cope  up  with
stress , depression or mental illness. Our app is made in Android Studio using
Native Android Development (JAVA + XML). It  is  provided by the login facility. 
Then there is a set of questions to analysis the current mental state of users.
Above activities employ the use of scroll view, linear layout, buttons, text views, etc.
Then there is a main activity which shows four different sections build using table layout.<br>
These sections are <b> Counselling, Healthcare, Openup</b> and <b> Suggestions.</b><br>
